## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, you are encouraged to create a pull request (PR) with the necessary fixes. This allows for a collaborative approach to addressing security issues. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name related to the vulnerability (e.g., `fix-security-issue`).
3. Implement the necessary changes to fix the vulnerability.
4. Include clear and concise commit messages describing the changes made.
5. Submit the PR, explaining the nature of the vulnerability and the proposed fix.
6. We will review the PR promptly and work with you to address any concerns or suggestions.
7. Once approved, we will merge the PR and release the fix as soon as possible.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure policy for security vulnerabilities. We request that you:

- Refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it.
- Provide us with reasonable time to assess and remediate the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly.
- Work with us in good faith to resolve the issue collaboratively.

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such, vulnerabilities will be addressed based on the project's available resources.
